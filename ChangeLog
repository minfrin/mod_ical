  *) Handle cases where icalrecur_weekday_to_string,
     icalrecurrencetype_month_is_leap and
     icalrecurrencetype_month_month are provided by libical.
     [Graham Leggett]

  *) Depend on httpd-devel / apache-devel / apache2-devel so that we

     don't remain in the calendar. [Graham Leggett <minfrin@sharp.fm>]

Changes with v0.0.4

  *) Simplify the XML processing through the use of
     xmlTextWriterWriteFormatString(), ensure XML is properly escaped.

  *) We change the content type, therefore we are a resource filter.
     [Graham Leggett <minfrin@sharp.fm>]

  *) Limit the sanity check for non calendar content to the negotiated
