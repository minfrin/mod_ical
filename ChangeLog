     don't remain in the calendar. [Graham Leggett <minfrin@sharp.fm>]

Changes with v0.0.4

  *) Fix an attempt to free up the icalcomponents twice. We free the
     icalparser instead. [Graham Leggett <minfrin@sharp.fm>]

     negotiate on Accept we add to it Vary.
     [Graham Leggett <minfrin@sharp.fm>]

  *) Simplify the XML processing through the use of
     xmlTextWriterWriteFormatString(), ensure XML is properly escaped.
     [Graham Leggett <minfrin@sharp.fm>]

  *) We change the content type, therefore we are a resource filter.
     [Graham Leggett <minfrin@sharp.fm>]

  *) Limit the sanity check for non calendar content to the negotiated
     ICAL filter only. [Graham Leggett <minfrin@sharp.fm>]
